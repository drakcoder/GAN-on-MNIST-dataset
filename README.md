### Basic Generated Adversarial networks on MNIST dataset


### Generated adversarial Networks:
Generated Adversarial Networks(GANs) are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methonds like CNNs or RNNs.

### Present Application
This technique mainly revolves around two models, namely:
1)the Generating model 
2)the Discriminating model
In this particular case, the generating model will be taking a point in latent space, which is a randomly generated 100 element vector in this particular case and gives out an (28,28,1) sized vecor of pixel intensities.

The discriminating model on the other hand takes the (28,28,1) sized vector which is given by the generating model and determines whether the generated image is fake or real. where fake in this case means that the image generated by the generating model is not a number and real means the image generated is a number.

### The Composite Model:

The composite model here is the combination of the generating model and the discriminating model.
